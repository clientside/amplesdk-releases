  and their respective agents have participated in the preparation hereof.

  or employees, but only by an instrument in writing signed by an authorized
  signatory of Clientside. When conflicting language exists between this
  Agreement and any other agreement included in this SDK, this Agreement shall
  supersede. You acknowledge that You have read this Agreement, understand it
  and that it is the complete and exclusive statement of your agreement with
  Clientside which supersedes any prior agreement, oral or written, between

  dealings of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
