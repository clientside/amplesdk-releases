				In this section we will learn where to download Ample SDK,
				how to set up the development environment which will include:
				<em>the client</em> in which application runs,<br />
				<em>the server</em> which serves application resources,
				<em>the IDE</em> that is used for developing code and
				<em>the debugger</em> that will help debugging the code and
				how to deploy Ample SDK for working.

					<p>
						If you haven't yet downloaded Ample SDK, go to the <link href="http://www.amplesdk.com/download/" title="Product site">Download Ample SDK</link> online page and obtain a copy.
						On this page you can always get the latest <em>stable version</em> of software as well as the latest <em>weekly build</em>. It is usually safe to download <em>weekly build</em> for development purposes.
						The software available on the site is licensed under "Free License".

						It is very likely that you already have the development environment setup that you are comfortbale with.

						The Client

						<p>
							An Ample SDK application to run properly requires a standalone or embedded web browser.
							The most widely used web browsers are:
						</p>
						<ul>
						    <li><link href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/" target="_blank" title="Product site">Internet Explorer 6+</link></li>
						    <li><link href="http://www.mozilla.org/" target="_blank" title="Product site">Mozilla FireFox 1+</link></li>
						    <li><link href="http://www.opera.com/" target="_blank" title="Product site">Opera 9+</link></li>
						    <li><link href="http://www.apple.com/safari/" target="_blank" title="Product site">Apple Safari 3+</link></li>
						    <li><link href="http://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank" title="Product site">Google Chrome 0+</link></li>
						    <li><link href="http://konqueror.kde.org/" target="_blank" title="Product site">Konqueror 3.5+</link></li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Pick up any, but remeber: you will need more then one browser installed on your system.
							This is in order to thouroughly test your application before it goes live.
							Although Ample SDK is there to shield you from the differences found in multiple browsers,
							you may still run into an issue that was not covered.
							This is mostly true for CSS styling where rendering behavior is not only strongly inconsistent across major vendors,
							but also gets changed with the evolution of their software.
							We recommend thourough testing application at least in most widely used browsers: Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Safari.

						The Server
					</locale>
				</title>
				<content>
					<locale>
						<p>
							You can use any web server to serve your application files.
							The most widely used web servers are:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><link href="http://httpd.apache.org/" title="Product site">Apache</link></li>
							<li>IIS</li>
							<li><link href="http://tomcat.apache.org/" title="Product site">Tomcat</link></li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The choice of a web server usually depends on server-side technology you need.
							For example it can be .Net, Java, PHP, Ruby or some other.

						The IDE
					</locale>
				</title>
				<content>
					<locale>
						<p>
							There is never a good recommendation on a what IDE to use. Some like apples, other like pears.
							However will try to highlight valuable features of an IDE that you might also find usefull:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Markup code Highlight / Completion / Validation</li>
							<li>CSS Code Highlight / Completion</li>
							<li>JavaScript code Highlight / Completion</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							The most widely used IDEs are:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><link href="http://www.eclipse.org/" title="Product site">Eclipse</link></li>
							<li><link href="http://www.netbeans.com/" title="Product site">Netbeans</link></li>
							<li><link href="http://www.aptana.com/" title="Product site">Aptana</link></li>
						</ul>

						The Debugger
					</locale>
				</title>
				<content>
					<locale>
						<p>
							The choice of debugger application is usually dependent on the choice of web browser you made earlier.
							A good debugger usually has following features:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>DOM Introspection</li>
							<li>JavaScript debug</li>
							<li>CSS Runtime Editing</li>
							<li>Network monitor</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Here Firefox's "<link href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843" title="Product site">Firebug</link>" is worth looking into,
							or Interent Explorer's "Development Tools" that is of a great value feature included in IE 8 and later.

					Deploying Ample SDK
				</locale>
			</title>
			<content>
				<locale>
					<p>
						Deploying Ample SDK for development is as easy as unpacking the dowloaded archive into a directory on your web server (for the sake of the following section let's call it <b>{AMPLESDK_FOLDER}</b>).
						Worth mentioning here is that you can also run examples as well as your applications directlly from the filesystem, however when developing true applications you will certainly need a web server to enable server-side scripting.

					Running "Hello World!" application
				</locale>
			</title>
			<content>
				<locale>
					<p>
						Now when you have everything in place you can try and run the "Hello World!" application.
						Navigate to <b>{AMPLESDK_FOLDER}</b><em>/examples/helloworld.html</em> file in your browser and see the result (Note: You may also run the file from your filesystem).
						If everything is allright you should see a page with the red text "Hello world!" in bold.
						When clicking on the text an alert should popup with a message about the element name it was cliecked on.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you do not experience the result described, there might be two reasons:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>You are running application from filesystem in a browser with high security restrictions (Solution: lift security restrictions in your browser)</li>
						<li>Your web-server does not serve content properly (Solution: investigate Network activity details)</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						You may also try other examples accessible at <b>{AMPLESDK_FOLDER}</b><em>/examples/index.html</em>
